# Employee Attrition Prediction

This project focuses on predicting **employee attrition** ‚Äî whether an employee is likely to leave the company ‚Äî using machine learning techniques. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), containing employee records with various demographic, workplace, and performance-related attributes.  

Attrition prediction helps organizations take proactive measures to improve employee retention, reduce turnover costs, and maintain a stable workforce.

## üìÇ Project Overview

- **Goal**: Build a predictive model to classify whether an employee will leave or stay.  
- **Dataset**: Kaggle‚Äôs Employee Attrition dataset (includes features like age, job role, work-life balance, satisfaction level, etc.).  
- **Approach**:  
  1. Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
  2. Feature engineering and selection.  
  3. Training classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).  
  4. Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
  5. Insights and recommendations based on key features influencing attrition.
